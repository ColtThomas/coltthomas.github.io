I'm looking to develop my skills a bit since I always seem to be lacking on something.
Below are some skills that employers have asked for:

- PCB design
- GIT source control and JIRA
- WIFI and Bluetooth chips
- Finish Udemy courses!
- Read a book on agile development/product development
- make an app with QT
- Linux networking stack and kernel
- Linux drivers
- PCI PCIe bus
