# cmthomas000.github.io


This repository is where I store my school and small personal projects for reference.  It will be updated over time as I continue through school.  Below is an outline of some of the files included:

## Portfolio HTML 

Visual documentation and presentation can be found using this [link](https://cmthomas000.github.io/index).This was done as practice for HTML and Javascript

## CheatSheet

For personal reference if I need to brush up on any information. This is where I'll put code examples, mathematic and algorithmic explanations, etc. Example projects may be included in the future.

## Projects 

All projects and sample code can be found in the /projects directory:

/articles - .html files for the portfolio.

/school - School projects.  They are divided by classes.  Projects will be added throughout the semesters.  I am currently working on documenting the labs.

/personal - Personal projects. 


School Projects included:
- Laser Tag Junior Project
- Digital Circuits labs in Verilog
- Embedded C class projects
- Matlab scripts from signal processing classes
