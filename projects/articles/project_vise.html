                        <p>Back in high school I would go hang out at wielding and machining shops, and I was always fascinated by the CNC machines.  Even though I chose to major in electrical engineering, I couldn't help but to take a machining class.</p>
                        <p>The vise project was the final project of the semester.  We were assigned into groups of five and asked to construct one vise per person.  The drawings were given to us (when I find them I will upload them) and we delegated the different parts out to reduce the quantity of changeovers needed to manufacture the project.</p>
                        <p>My assigned part was the middle block that holds the guide rods and the threaded shaft.  The material we used was a hardened steel.  One of the critical lessons that I learned from working on this part was that time could be saved by keeping parts in the vise as long as possible.  For example, when drilling the holes, I would keep the working part in the vise until I finished with as many drilling operations as possible.  I still had to perform changeovers with the drill bits, but that took less time than trying to recalibrate and zero the part.  At the end we eventually assembled our parts.  Some parts fit together really well while others were a tight fit.  This showed me how important tolerances are when it comes to quality.</p>
                        <p>Overall, the project was a success and also really fun.  As soon as I find the drawings to the vise I can do a walk-through of the manufacturing process.</p>
